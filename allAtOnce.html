            <h3>New found observations</h3>
            <p>We once thought that biological systems are too warm, too wet, and too chaotic for quantum physics to play any part in how they work. But it now seems that life is employing feats of quantum physics every day in messy, real-world systems, including quantum tunneling, wave-particle duality, and even entanglement. </p>

            <h3>The human nose</h3>
            <p>The human nose can distinguish over one trillion smells. But how exactly the sense of smell works is still a mystery. When a molecule referred to as an odorant enters our nose, it binds to receptors. Initially, the prevailing theory held that these receptors used the shape of the odorants to differentiate smells. The so-called lock and key model suggests that when an odorant finds the right receptor, it fits into it and triggers a specific smell. But the lock and key model ran into trouble when tested. Subjects were able to tell two scents apart, even when the odorant molecules were identical in shape. Some other process must be at work.</p>

            <h3>How does Quantum Biology come into play?</h3>
            <p>Another, still controversial, model suggests that our noses are sensitive to the vibrations within odorant molecules. These vibrations occur when individual atoms within the molecule oscillate back and forth with respect to one another, as if they were loaded onto tiny springs. When an odorant settles into a receptor, the energy of its vibrations causes an electron to quantum tunnel to another location in the receptor. </p>

            <h3>More implications of Quantum Biology</h3>
            <p>Quantum mechanics might also play a part in evolution. DNA has four bases, called A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T (thymine). The “shapes” of these bases make it so that A always bonds to T, and G to C. During replication, an enzyme “unzips” the DNA strand from top to bottom. Both sides of this unzipped DNA can now be built into identical DNA strands, matching A to C and G to T.</p>
